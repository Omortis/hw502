# Exercise 5: Challenge
#
# Write a function that takes in a list of 3 numbers and returns a
# list of all possible permutations of that list.
#
# You can do this by brute force and but also try using recursion. If
# you figure out a recursive solution, try to make it work for a
# list of 𝑛 numbers.
